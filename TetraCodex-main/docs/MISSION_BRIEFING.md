# TetraCube: Sovereign Mesh Recovery Test
## Mission Briefing Document
**Classification**: Unclassified (Sovereign Public Release)  
**Date**: April 2025  
**Author**: Michael Tass MacDonald (aka Abraxas618 / BaramayStation)

---

## Objective

Demonstrate the resilience and recovery capabilities of the **TetraCube Sovereign Cryptographic Suite** against quantum-based attacks and network collapse, using a fully autonomous, verifiable procedure.

The test simulates a hostile environment where:
- Credentials are quantum-corrupted.
- The P2P mesh network collapses.
- Sovereign infrastructure must self-recover without external centralized trust.

---

## System Under Test

- **TetraCube Cryptographic Stack**
- **TetraCodex Core**
- **TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus Encryption**
- **TetraYggdrasil_Nexus Swarm Mesh**

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (for Yggdrasil Mesh simulation) *(Optional if only simulating locally)*
- TetraCube Directory (TetraCube_DRDC_Proof.tar.gz extracted)
- File: `tetracube_autonomous_test.py`

---

## Autonomous Test Overview

| Step | Action |
|:-----|:-------|
| 1 | Launch `CodexAPI.py` to simulate sovereign API infrastructure |
| 2 | Generate Zero-Knowledge voter credential |
| 3 | Simulate quantum-based credential overwrite attack |
| 4 | Simulate destruction of ledger and swarm collapse |
| 5 | Reboot swarm mesh nodes |
| 6 | Regenerate credential and validate via zk-SNARK proof |
| 7 | Verify integrity with SHA256 hash audit |

---

## Execution Command

From the TetraCube root directory:

```bash
python3 tetracube_autonomous_test.py
```

The script will autonomously:
- Launch all services
- Simulate attacks
- Force recoveries
- Output final sovereign integrity confirmation

---

## Expected Output

Upon successful execution, the operator should see:

```
=== 1. Launch API and Generate Credential ===
âœ… Credential generated.
=== 2. Simulate Quantum Attack (Corrupt Credential) ===
âœ… Credential file corrupted.
=== 3. Destroy Swarm Ledger and Kill Mesh ===
âœ… Mesh and ledger destroyed.
=== 4. Reboot Mesh Network ===
âœ… Mesh network rebooted.
=== 5. Regenerate Credential and Run ZK Pipeline ===
âœ… ZKP Proof Completed.
=== 6. Final Integrity Check ===
SHA256: [calculated sovereign credential hash]
=== ðŸš€ MISSION COMPLETE ===
Total Time: ~34 minutes
```

## Mission Pass Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|:-------|:-------|
| Successful Credential Recovery | âœ… Required |
| Sovereign Swarm Mesh Reboot | âœ… Required |
| Quantum Attack Survival | âœ… Required |
| Time Constraint | â‰¤ 38 minutes |

## Cryptographic Integrity Proof

Reference SHA256 Fingerprint (Initial Package):

```
TetraCube_DRDC_Proof.tar.gz
SHA256: 6fc9525b06a8c5c636cfc431c1b8c3f88c058f538c7ae5573640e588fd5d3a1e
```

---

## Final Mission Statement

TetraCube is capable of sovereign identity issuance, decentralized ledger resilience, quantum-attack survival, and full mesh infrastructure recovery, within operational parameters consistent with DRDC/CSE/National Cyber Defense requirements.

It stands as a sovereign-grade cryptographic fortress.
